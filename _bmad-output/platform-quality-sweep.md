# EduFlow Platform Quality Sweep — BMad Method Master Tracker

**Started:** 2026-05-15
**Goal:** Enterprise-grade quality across the entire platform via full BMad ceremony applied part-by-part.
**Method:** For each part — `document-project` → `create-architecture` (if needed) → `create-epics-and-stories` → `check-implementation-readiness` → per-story `CS → DS → QA → CR` → `retrospective` → adversarial review.

## Sequence

User-confirmed order: **3 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → ...**

| # | Part | Status | Sub-stories | Started | Closed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Auth + RBAC** | ✅ done | 12/12 original concerns closed + all 16 Part 1.5 findings closed | 2026-05-15 | 2026-05-15 | Part 1 hardening + Part 1.5 fix sweep complete. ~119 of ~130 inline role checks migrated to `Depends(require_role/require_owner/require_owner_or_principal)`; 11 remaining are documented composite/dynamic gates annotated with `# auth:`. Migration 016 idempotent; scope_resolver denies by default; designation fallback removed; cookie phantom evicted; concurrent-refresh test now deterministically races; scoped_query rejects cross-branch attempts. 260 backend tests passing (up from 224 baseline). See `parts/auth-rbac/review-findings-and-fix-plan.md` for the 16 patches A–P. |
| 2 | **AI Layer** | ✅ done | 11 of 11 patches landed (P1–P11) | 2026-05-15 | 2026-05-15 | Audit done (47 raw findings → 11 patches). Wave 1 (P1–P5 Critical) `e8b4a70`. Wave 2 (P6–P11 Important+Polish) `7e82b31`. 311 backend tests passing (was 260 at Part 1 start). P6: registry sub_categories + _is_tool_authorized single gate; P7: announcement moderation in tool (pending_approval for teacher/student audience); P8: content filter on rich_blocks + tool data for students; P9: confirm-token tenant binding (school_id/branch_id), peek raises on Mongo error, $gte TTL, compensating decrement; P10: expires_at required on overrides, stable sort, migration 017; P11: safe_token_count coerce, restricted_exact+9 keys, phone exact-match, random.uniform delay, SSE keepalive comment, zero-width whitespace, _json_candidates rich extraction, numeric param validators. |

## Per-Part BMad Cycle (Full Ceremony)

1. **Scope & document** — `bmad-document-project` on the part's surface area → `_bmad-output/parts/<part-slug>/scope.md`
2. **Architecture** — `bmad-create-architecture` if architectural changes are expected → `_bmad-output/parts/<part-slug>/architecture.md`
3. **Stories** — `bmad-create-epics-and-stories` → list of stories targeted at the part
4. **Readiness check** — `bmad-check-implementation-readiness` → gate before coding
5. **Per story** — `bmad-create-story` → `bmad-dev-story` → `bmad-qa-generate-e2e-tests` → `bmad-code-review`
6. **Retro** — `bmad-retrospective` → lessons captured for the next part
7. **Final adversarial pass** — `bmad-review-adversarial-general` on the whole part's diff

## Stale-context discipline

`_bmad-output/project-context.md` is the foundation that every BMad skill loads as persistent fact. **Refresh it before each Part kicks off** via `bmad-generate-project-context` — the codebase moves faster than the document.

## Decisions captured

- **Frontend Foundation is a separate part (#8)** — shared components audited once, not re-touched per vertical.
- **Per-part rigor: full ceremony** — slower but enterprise-grade.
- **Teacher and Student verticals are gated** on Story 7-39 (auth activation) regardless of sweep order.

## Outstanding cross-cutting risks (track here as discovered)

- Migration 014 (`014_ensure_maintenance_user`) is missing from `run_all.py` — pre-existing, surface during Part 4 (Multi-tenancy + Data Layer).
- ALLOWED_ROLES override may unlock students past their YAML floor — surface during Part 1 (Auth + RBAC).
- Part 3 Owner role hardening follow-up remains deferred: complete FR8 owner-exclusive endpoint role-matrix tests for the 8 scoped endpoints, reach the NFR2 backend test-count target (≥360), and rerun pytest/frontend build once `pytest` and `frontend/node_modules` are available. Current pass already patched tenant scoping, announcement moderation, auth-dependency migration, fee-sync field whitelisting, and frontend auth header consistency, but this follow-up must close the remaining verification backlog before marking Part 3 done.
